## Display Information

The image associated with the wrapper token (*IKB Cachet de Garantie*) has been created at 4K resolution with a 1:1 aspect ratio for online display. However, for presentation on a display with a typical aspect ratio, cropping the top and bottom of the image is OK. For information about the display value of the unwrapped *Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility*, please consult *The Blue Paper.*  

## Artist's Statement Regarding NFT Transactions, Provenance, and Verifiability

The *IKB Cachet de Garantie* smart contract is deployed from the same address (0x88AE96845e157558ef59e9Ff90E766E22E480390) which deployed the original _Digital Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility_ contract on August 29, 2017.

The tokenID of each *IKB Cachet de Garantie* wIKB token is the same as the edition number of the original IKB token which it wraps. Like IKB, the wIKB tokens are zero indexed, beginning at 0 and ending at 100, for a total of 101 tokens. The wrapped IKB token edition number is also written in the image associated with that wIKB token. Series 0 token wrappers also include the date of minting, hand-written.  
  
In the course of creating this project, I have spent a long time thinking about the current practices relating to the deployment, record-keeping, and custodianship of art linked to non-fungible tokens, and I have decided that it was important for me that the *IKB Cachet de Garantie* smart contract and metadata offer some small suggestions for improving those practices.

It feels strange to me to call an artwork a 1/1 edition when it is, in fact, linked to tokenID[22465], or a similar number, on a contract deployed by SuperRare or another centralized platform. 

While the generic contract template is useful in many cases, major platforms' exclusion of custom artist contracts is a major creative restriction for artists exploring the potential of this medium.  

The indiscriminate indexing of tokens feels like sloppy record-keeping. I prefer a nice clean receipt. The disconnect between contract ownership and the artist feels like the artist is placing an irresponsible level of trust in the contract owner's custodianship.

I believe that, wherever feasible, each artwork series by an established artist should be deployed through its own contract, from a wallet address owned by either the artist or the gallery representing them. 

I also believe that including documents like this one in NFT metadata is good practice. It is important that contextual information about the artwork is preserved to the same standards as the artwork itself, and remains immutably linked to the artwork.  

Many thanks to the artists, gallerists, curators, coders, conservationists, and friends with whom I have shared conversations on this topic, and who have inspired me greatly.

## Legal

INTENTION OF THIS DOCUMENT:  
  
The rights of collectors and artists are important. The following terms are created with the intent of preserving the artist's copyright and moral rights over the artwork, while expanding the rights for collectors beyond existing Canadian copyright laws, in order to acknowledge emerging ways of displaying digital artworks. These legal terms should be considered an AMENDMENT to the terms of transaction of the original IKB token, which are outlined in the Blue Paper. 

These legal terms are adapted from the _NFT License_, written by Dapper Labs. Many thanks to them and other innovators in this field for creating this template.


1. DEFINITIONS: 

THE ARTIST (CREATOR) refers to Mitchell F. Chan  

THE COLLECTOR (YOU) refers to the individual who can prove ownership or custody of the wallet or smart contract identified as ownerOf() the token associated with the artwork.  

THE ARTWORK (ART) refers to all of 1) The wIKB token itself; 2) the specific image identified in the metadata linked to that wIKB token; 3) the metadata of the wIKB token; 4) the specific IKB token which is held in the Wrapped IKB smart contract and which as an edition() value corresponding with the tokenID() value of the wIKB token owned by the collector; 5) the actual, immaterial Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility which is linked to that IKB token.

NFT means any blockchain-tracked, non-fungible token, such as those conforming to the ERC-721 standard, the wIKB token, or the original IKB token.

EXTENSIONS means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as extensions or overlays to the Art, (ii) do not modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art.
  

2. OWNERSHIP:

You may also produce physical copies of the image file referenced in the token metadata, or the code of the smart contracts associated with the artwork, for non-commercial use. 

4. RESTRICTIONS:
