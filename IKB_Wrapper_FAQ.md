# IKB Wrapper FAQ  

1. An _IKB Cachet de Garantie_ token allows the original IKB token to be listed and traded on OpenSea and other NFT platforms.  

2. The IKB Wrapper includes metadata which makes immutable the holder's ownership rights over the IKB token. In this way, the IKB wrapper is not only a functional tool which extends the original non-fungible IKB token, but is also a receipt for the token. The token also links to (and confer ownership of) a .PNG image, which is a depiction of this receipt. 

**In this way, the IKB wrapper is a pure the NFT in-and-of-itself**, albeit one which requires possession of an original IKB token to mint.


## Why does IKB need to be wrapped to appear on Rarible, OpenSea, and other platforms?

The IKB token associated with the original *Digital Zone of Immaterial Sensibility* was a non-fungible token (it kept individual records differentiating properties of each token), but was created before the ERC721 NFT standard was created and therefore was built on the ERC20 template,  like the CryptoPunks contract. Hence, because certain functions of the IKB contract do not follow the same conventions as later ERC721 tokens, it is necessary to place those tokens inside another contract which _does_ follow those conventions. 


## What is the image associated with the Wrapper?

The image that is "purchased" when the IKB wrapper is minted is an image of a receipt for the original IKB token. This receipt is modelled after the one that Yves Klein issued to purchasers of the Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility from 1958-1962.

Each image is unique, and contains a hand-written edition and series number, signature, and in some cases, a date of minting. 

The image was created and rendered in Blender, using a hand-drawn image texture to fill in the receipt form (edition number, signature, etcetera).

Please note that there is no image metadata associated with the original IKB token. This is intentional. The Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility is an immaterial artwork. The wrapper, however, does have image metadata: each wrapper shows the receipt for the purchase of the original Zone, as it is this receipt and _its_ value which will be transacted, as opposed to the immaterial value of the Digital Zone itself. 

As per the collector rights which are immutably stated in the wrapper metadata, the image and all other metadata associated with the wrapper are owned by the holder of the wrapper. This image and metadata is associated with the wrapper, and not the IKB token contained therein.


## Why do the wrappers look different?

The wrapper for each token is unique. 

Series 0 wrappers all have the same uniform blue background. Series 0 wrappers also display the date that the token was minted. Each subsequent series has a different coloured background, and different coloured 'IKB' watermarks on the receipt.

Each wrapper shows the edition and series number of the token, and is digitally signed by the artist. 


## Wrapping and unwrapping

You can wrap and unwrap the same IKB token as many times as you like. The tokenID of your wrapper will always correspond to the edition number of the IKB token. Unwrapping always transfers the IKB token to wallet which owns the wrapper.

## Do I need to wrap my IKB token?

No. The IKB token continues to function perfectly as a token denoting ownership of a *Digital Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility*. But note that the wrapper 'receipt' image is associated only with the wrapper, and not with the IKB token, so if your IKB token is not wrapped you do not own that image.
